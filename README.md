# RockTheCode-proyecto6

An issue tracker for Neighbours.

## The problem

Within blocks of flats there are always a group of volunteers that like to look after the building and other neighbors.

The problem is that the historical issues are lost between neighbours and some other neighbours might want to pickup where a previous neighbour picked up.

## The proposed solution: Issue tracker

A neighbour raises an issue and describes it.

authour: string
Description: string
ref flat Optional
ref issueUpdate optional

As hinted above The issue has a flat location.

court : string

Another neighbour might want to update an existing issue.

authour: string
descrition: string

## Reach goal
